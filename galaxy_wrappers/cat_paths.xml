  <help>
Datasets represented as pathsets can be split in a number of files.
This tool takes all of them and concatenates them into a single output file.

In your workflow, you'll need to explicitly set the appropriate data format on the
output dataset with an Action to "Change Datatype".

"Delete remote input data" option
====================================
With this option, after the data has been concated into the new Galaxy dataset,
the original files that were referenced by the pathset are deleted.  This effectively
tells the action to "move" the data instead of a "copying" it and helps
avoid amassing intermediate data in your Hadoop workspace.


"Use Hadoop-based program" option
====================================

With this option you will use your entire Hadoop cluster to simultaneously write
multiple parts of the final file.  For this to be possible, the Hadoop nodes
must be able to access the Galaxy file space directly.  In addition, to achieve
reasonable results the Galaxy workspace should on a parallel shared file system.
