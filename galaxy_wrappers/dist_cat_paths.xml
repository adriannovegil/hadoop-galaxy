  <help>
    Datasets represented as pathsets can be split in a number of files.
    This tool takes all of them and concatenates them into a single output file using
    a Hadoop-based program (so the work is done in parallel).

    If the pathset refers to directories, the files under its tree are concatenated
    in alphabetical order by name.

    In your workflow, you'll need to explicitly set the appropriate data format on the
    output dataset with an Action to "Change Datatype".
